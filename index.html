                    <h3>The Solar System</h3>
                    <p>The Solar System is a vast space with the Sun at its center, surrounded by planets, dwarf planets, asteroids, and comets. It formed more than 4.5 billion years ago and continues to evolve today. Each planet has its own unique structure, atmosphere, and history, making the study of our system incredibly fascinating.</p>

                    <h3>Planets, Stars, and other Celestial Worlds</h3>
                    <p>Space is far more than just the Solar System. Around us are billions of galaxies, each containing billions of stars. Some stars are hundreds of times larger than the Sun, while others shine faintly. Nebulae, black holes, and exoplanets form the endless canvas of the universe. Scientists constantly discover new worlds that may have atmospheres, water, and even potential signs of life.

                    <h3>The Future of Space Exploration</h3>
                    <p>Modern space missions reveal new parts of the universe every year. Reusable rockets, robotic rovers, and advanced telescopes bring us closer to understanding the origin of life and perhaps finding a second home for humanity. Space technology is evolving so quickly that the limits of what we can achieve are expanding every day.</p>
