                <h3>Black holes</h3>
                <p>Black holes are regions in space with gravity so intense that nothing, not even light, can escape, formed from the collapse of massive stars or other processes, creating incredibly dense points where matter is squeezed into a tiny volume, warping spacetime and affecting nearby stars and galaxies. The biggest black hole currently known by mass is often cited as TON 618, an ultramassive black hole powering a quasar, estimated at 66 billion times the mass of our Sun.</p>

                <h3>Galaxies</h3>
                <p>Galaxies are massive, gravitationally bound systems containing billions to trillions of stars, planets, gas, dust, and dark matter, forming the fundamental building blocks of the universe, like our own Milky Way</p>

                <h3>Nebulas</h3>
                <p>A nebula is a giant, beautiful cloud of interstellar dust and gas (mostly hydrogen and helium) in space, acting as cosmic "nurseries" where new stars are born or the remnants of dying stars, like from a supernova, creating stunning, vast structures that can span light-years across.</p>
